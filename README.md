## 🧠 Game Overview  

- The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.  
- You make guesses until you find the correct number.  
- After each guess, you’ll get a hint — whether your guess is **too high** or **too low**.  
- You can also request additional hints, but doing so **reduces your score**.

## 💡 Hints  

- **Hint 1:** Reveals a **range** around the correct number.  
- **Hint 2:** Tells you if the number is **odd or even**.  

⚠️ Each hint or incorrect guess reduces your points.
